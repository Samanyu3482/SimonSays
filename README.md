#  Simon Says - Memory Game

A fun little memory game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Inspired by the classic "Simon" electronic toy — watch the color sequence and repeat it. 
Each level adds a new color to the pattern. How far can you go without messing up?

# How It Works

- The game flashes a sequence of colors.
- Your job is to repeat the exact pattern by clicking the colored buttons.
- Get it right, and the pattern gets longer.
- Miss a step, and it's game over!

No libraries, no frameworks — just good old HTML, CSS, and JS.
